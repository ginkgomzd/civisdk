# CiviSDK
docker-composition for a CiviCRM development environment with recommended tools

### Install

Depends on ginkgomzd/make-do for `make` includes, chiefly to manage configurations.

The first time you run the shell container, or by calling `make install` explicitly, install-sdk.mk is run to fetch the SDK libraries. This could take some time, and the files will be downloaded to `volumes/home/`.

## Use the Source, Luke

`Makefile` in the repo root is a good starting place. Next stop should be `docker-compose.yml`.

## Orientation

Create your app in `/app`. If you build your app with a Makefile, then just clone your repo and run `make build` (in this dir).
It will run `make` in the sdk shell container.

### Containers

Automatically starts the web-server and MySQL server. Additional containers can be started for mysql client session, or an SDK-enabled bash shell.

Coming Soon: proxy-cache; log tailing; file watcher (live-reload);

### Volumes

`volumes/home` is mounted to the shell container and contains the SDK libraries (like: cv, civix, drush, wp-cli...).

Docker-managed volumes are created for `/var/www/html` and mysql data files.

### Config

Configure the docker-compose environment in `conf/build-args.conf`. The `.env` is autogenerated when make detects that one of the config files it depends on are newer. Re-make explicitly with `make .env`. https://docs.docker.com/compose/environment-variables/

The first time you run one of the SDK make targets, you will be prompted to interactively supply environment configs. Chiefly, this is the MySQL configurations needed. Either add additional configurations to `conf/build-args.conf` or add new files. Be sure to add new config files as prerequisites to the `.env` make recipe.

For interactive config support, add new configs to the corresponding `.tpl`. You can add help-text as a comment (shell-comment style) at the end of the line. Try `make add-config` to interactively extend the config-file template (`.tpl`).

## Debugging

The php image is configured with xdebug.

Use `docker-compose logs` to see PHP and MySQL log output. https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/logs/

## Roadmap

### CMS/Civi Logs

Run a service container that detects the CMS deployed, and locates CiviCRM ConfigAndLog, and tail's those logs.

### Proxy Cache

Speed-up sdk and app builds by caching downloads of external dependencies.
